# Using Customer Buying Patterns to Improve Warehouse Layout

Develop a data-driven approach to optimize the warehouse layout by leveraging Association Rule mining 

<b>Current Situation:</b> Warehouse agents have reported inefficiencies in the current warehouse layout, leading to increased picking times and fatigue.<br> 
These inefficiencies are likely due to inefficient inventory management within the warehouse.Order picking efficiency refers to the speed and accuracy with which workers can select items to fulfil customer orders.


<b>Proposed Solution:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Utilize the annual sales data to optimize the warehouse layout.</li>
<li>To identify frequently co-purchased SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) and strategically placing them in close proximity, thereby improving order picking efficiency and reducing fulfilment time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

By analyzing annual sales data, following are identified:
<ul>
<b>Top N SKUs:</b> The products contributing the most to overall sales<br>
<b>Frequently co-purchased SKUs</b> in close proximity to minimize travel distance during order fulfillment.<br>
</ul>

This information can be leveraged to develop a revised warehouse layout that strategically places high-demand SKUs in easily accessible locations for quicker picking. The expected outcomes include:<br>

<ul>
<li>Increased order picking efficiency through reduced travel distances and optimized product placement</li>
<li>Reduced agent fatigue and frustration by minimizing unnecessary movement.</li>
<li>Improved customer satisfaction through faster fulfillment times.</li>
</ul>
